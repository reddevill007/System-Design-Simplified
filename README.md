# System Design Simplified

### **What is System Design?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image.png)

Imagine you're throwing a massive house party. You’re inviting 500 people (wild, right?). Now, think about what you'll need to ensure the party runs smoothly:

- Enough food and drinks.
- A way to let people in (security).
- Music that keeps the vibe alive.
- Space for people to sit, dance, and chill.
- A way to handle unexpected situations (someone spills soda on the couch or the speaker dies).

**System Design is like planning this party.**

In tech, it’s about designing a system (like Facebook, Netflix, or Uber) so that it works well when thousands, millions, or even billions of people use it.

---

### **Why do we need System Design?**

Let’s stick to the party example:

- If you only make snacks for 10 people, the other 490 guests will be _hangry_ (like designing for low capacity).
- If you hire just one DJ with no backup, the vibe will die if their laptop crashes (no redundancy).
- If you let everyone rush in at the same time, chaos will break loose (no proper handling of traffic).

**In real-life systems**, like Instagram or Amazon, similar problems happen:

- What if too many people log in at once?
- What if one server crashes?
- How do we store and retrieve millions of cat videos (ahem...data)?

System Design solves all these problems.

---

### **Key Concepts in System Design**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%201.png)

Let’s break this into party terms:

1. **Scalability**:

   The ability to handle a growing number of people (users).

   - Example: Planning more food, chairs, and bathrooms as more guests (users) arrive.

2. **Load Balancer**:

   Imagine you hire two bartenders instead of one. A person (load balancer) directs people to whichever bartender has the shortest line.

3. **Database**:

   A fridge where you store all your snacks and drinks (data). You need to organize it so you can quickly find the soda or chips when needed.

4. **Caching**:

   Keep popular snacks, like chips, on the table for quick access instead of making guests go to the fridge every time (speeding things up).

5. **Redundancy**:

   Having a backup speaker or extra pizza in case the main ones fail. In systems, this means having extra servers or copies of data.

6. **Latency**:

   How long it takes for a guest to get their drink. If the bartender is slow, your party-goer gets annoyed (sluggish system).

7. **Fault Tolerance**:

   If the main power goes out, you’ve got a generator to keep the party going. Systems need to stay online even when parts of them fail.

---

### **A Fun Real-Life Example**

Imagine designing a **Pizza Delivery System**:

1. **User places an order on an app** → App sends a request to the kitchen (backend server).
2. **The kitchen checks inventory** → Is there enough dough and toppings? (database query).
3. **The order is prepared** → Workers (backend processes) handle the order.
4. **Delivery is assigned** → An algorithm (load balancer) finds the nearest driver.
5. **The pizza is delivered** → Driver reaches your house (low latency and reliable system).

---

### **Why is System Design Fun?**

It’s like being a creative problem solver. You're designing something that millions of people will use without them even realizing all the magic happening behind the scenes.

So, think of System Design as planning the ultimate event—but for apps and websites instead of parties

### **What is a Database Index?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%202.png)

Imagine you have a giant book with a million pages. If you want to find a specific topic—say, "How to Train Your Dragon"—you wouldn’t start flipping through every page, right? That’d take forever.

Instead, you’d go to the **index at the back of the book**. The index tells you:

- What topic you’re looking for.
- The exact page number where it’s located.

This is exactly what a **database index** does for your data. It’s a shortcut that helps the database quickly find the information you’re asking for, instead of flipping through every "page" (row) in the database.

---

### **Why Do We Need Indexes?**

Let’s say you’re running a **library**:

- A visitor comes in and says, “I need the book _Harry Potter_.”
- Without an index (catalog), you’d have to search _every single shelf_ to find it. That’s **slow**.
- With an index, you immediately know: "Oh, that’s in Aisle 3, Shelf 7." Super fast!

---

### **How Does It Work?**

Let’s take a **real-life database example**:

- You’re running an online store with a table of **products**.

  ```yaml
  Products Table:
  | ProductID | Name         | Price |
  |-----------|--------------|-------|
  | 1         | iPhone       | 1000  |
  | 2         | MacBook      | 1500  |
  | 3         | Headphones   | 200   |

  ```

- Now, imagine this table has _a million products_! If someone searches for “MacBook,” the database has to go through every single row to find it.

When you create an **index on the Name column**, it’s like creating a shortcut. The database organizes the product names in a way that’s faster to search (like sorting alphabetically and adding bookmarks).

---

### **Types of Indexes (Fun Examples)**

1. **Single Column Index**:

   Like a single list of names in alphabetical order.

   - Example: You create an index on the "Name" column.

2. **Composite Index**:

   Like organizing names **by city and then by age**.

   - Example: You index both "Category" and "Price" columns to find, say, _cheap electronics_.

3. **Unique Index**:

   Imagine a school where every student gets a unique ID card. No duplicates allowed.

   - Example: Indexing an "Email" column ensures no two users register with the same email.

4. **Full-Text Index**:

   Like searching for keywords in a paragraph.

   - Example: If someone searches “wireless headphones,” the database quickly finds all matching product descriptions.

---

### **What Happens Without Indexes?**

Let’s say your friend runs a pizza place, and they’ve got a notebook with _every single order they’ve ever received_. If someone calls and says,

“Can you check my last order? My name’s John.”

Your friend flips through **every page** to find your name. It takes forever!

If they had an **index (e.g., alphabetical list of customer names)**, they’d jump to "J" in seconds and find John’s order.

---

### **Drawbacks of Indexes** (Real-Life Relatable Problems)

Indexes are magical, but they come with some downsides:

1. **Takes Up Space**:

   Just like an index in a book adds extra pages, indexes in databases take up extra space.

2. **Slows Down Writes**:

   If you’re constantly adding new orders to your pizza place notebook, you also need to update the index every time. This slows things down a bit.

---

### **Quick Analogy Summary**

A database index is like the index in a book or a catalog in a library—it helps you find things fast! Without it, searching would be slow and painful. But remember, keeping the index up-to-date adds a little extra work.

---

### **How Databases Create and Use Indexes**

When you create an index in a database, it’s like building a **data structure** in the background to organize and store your data in a way that makes searches faster. The database uses these data structures to look things up efficiently.

Here’s a simple breakdown of **how an index works behind the scenes**:

1. **Choose a Data Structure**:
   - The database picks a data structure (e.g., B-trees, hash maps, or LSM trees) based on the use case.
   - The data structure organizes the column(s) you’re indexing.
2. **Maintain the Index**:
   - When you insert, update, or delete rows in the table, the index also gets updated to reflect the changes.
3. **Use the Index for Queries**:
   - When you search for something (e.g., `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'MacBook'`), the database checks the index first to find where the data is stored.
   - After finding the location in the index, it fetches the actual data from the table.

---

### **Different Types of Indexes**

### 1. **B-Tree Index (Most Common)**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%203.png)

Think of a B-tree as a giant, well-organized family tree. It’s the most common index type in databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

- **How It Works**:
  - Data is stored in a **hierarchical structure** with nodes.
  - Each node has sorted keys and pointers to its children.
  - Searching involves starting at the root and following the pointers until the desired key is found.
  - Balanced trees ensure that no matter where the data is, it takes roughly the same time to find it.
- **Use Case**:
  - Great for range queries like `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 500`.
- **Real-Life Analogy**:
  - Think of a B-tree like a **phonebook**:
    - You look at the first few letters (root).
    - You narrow down the range (child nodes) until you find the name.

---

### 2. **Hash Index**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%204.png)

A hash index is like a super-fast lookup table based on a **hashing function**.

- **How It Works**:
  - The column values are passed through a hash function that maps them to a specific bucket.
  - When searching for a value, the database directly checks the corresponding bucket.
- **Advantages**:
  - Lightning-fast for equality searches (`=`), like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 42`.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Not good for range queries because hashing scrambles the data (e.g., `BETWEEN`, `<`, `>` won’t work).
- **Use Case**:
  - Perfect for queries with exact matches, like searching by user ID or email.
- **Real-Life Analogy**:
  - Think of it as a **locker system** at the gym:
    - You know your locker number (hash value) and go straight to it.
    - But you can’t find all lockers “greater than 100” because they’re randomly arranged.

---

### 3. **LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree)**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%205.png)

LSM trees are like efficient **grocery delivery systems** that sort and batch updates. They’re commonly used in NoSQL databases like **Cassandra**, **HBase**, and **LevelDB**.

- **How It Works**:
  1. Writes are first stored in memory (a **memtable**).
  2. Periodically, the memtable is written to disk as a sorted file (an **SSTable**).
  3. Old SSTables are merged and compacted to keep things organized.
- **Advantages**:
  - Great for write-heavy workloads because writes are fast and batched.
  - Supports very large datasets.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Reads can be slower because the database may need to look through multiple SSTables on disk.
- **Use Case**:
  - Best for systems with high write throughput, like logging systems or real-time analytics.

---

### 4. **SSTable (Sorted String Table)**

An SSTable is a file format used by LSM trees to store sorted key-value pairs on disk.

- **How It Works**:
  - Keys and values are stored in sorted order.
  - Indexes are created for quick lookups.
  - To find data, the database searches the SSTable or its accompanying index.
- **Real-Life Analogy**:
  - Imagine a **library with sorted bookshelves**. Each shelf has a mini index to tell you which book is where.

---

### 5. **Full-Text Index**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%206.png)

A full-text index is designed to search large amounts of text data, like in a search engine.

- **How It Works**:
  - The database tokenizes the text (splits it into words).
  - It creates an index of these words and their locations.
  - When searching, it matches the tokens to the index.
- **Use Case**:
  - Perfect for search functionality, like finding products with descriptions containing "wireless headphones."

---

### **How Databases Pick the Right Index**

Databases are smart—they choose the best index based on:

1. **Query Type**:
   - Equality vs. range queries.
   - Example: B-tree for ranges, hash for exact matches.
2. **Data Volume**:
   - Huge datasets? LSM trees or partitioned indexes might work better.
3. **Read vs. Write Heavy**:
   - Write-heavy systems might prefer LSM trees for batch writes.

---

### **Real-Life Example Combining Indexes**

Let’s say you’re designing a **food delivery app**:

1. **Hash Index**: Quickly find users by their unique ID or email.
2. **B-Tree Index**: Handle range queries, like finding restaurants within 5 km.
3. **LSM Tree**: Store logs of all delivery updates efficiently.
4. **Full-Text Index**: Let users search menus with complex phrases like “spicy vegan tacos.”

### **Summary Table of Index Types**

| **Index Type**      | **Best For**                 | **Data Structure**        | **Example Use**                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **B-Tree**          | Range and equality queries   | Hierarchical tree         | Prices, timestamps                          |

### **What is a Transaction?**

In simple terms, a transaction is a sequence of one or more operations (like reading, writing, or updating data) performed as a single, logical unit of work. Transactions are all about ensuring that a database maintains its integrity, even in the face of errors or crashes.

---

### **What Does ACID Stand For?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%207.png)

ACID is a set of properties that ensure **reliability and consistency** in database transactions:

1. **Atomicity**
2. **Consistency**
3. **Isolation**
4. **Durability**

Let’s explore each one with real-world analogies and dive into the technical implementation.

---

### **1. Atomicity ("All or Nothing")**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%208.png)

**Definition**: A transaction is an all-or-nothing operation. Either **all the steps** in the transaction succeed, or none of them are applied.

**Real-Life Analogy**:

Imagine you’re withdrawing cash from an ATM. There are two steps:

1. Deduct money from your bank account.
2. Dispense the cash from the ATM.

If the ATM deducts money from your account but then crashes before dispensing the cash, it’d be chaos, right?

Atomicity ensures that both steps happen together or neither happens at all.

**How Databases Implement Atomicity**:

- **Undo Logs**:
  - Before making changes, the database writes the original data to a log.
  - If a failure occurs mid-transaction, the database can roll back to the original state.
- Example in SQL:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
  COMMIT; -- Only finalizes if both updates succeed
  ```

---

### **2. Consistency ("The Rules Are Always Followed")**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%209.png)

**Definition**: A transaction must ensure that the database moves from one **valid state** to another, maintaining all defined rules (like constraints, triggers, etc.).

**Real-Life Analogy**:

Think of transferring $100 between two friends. After the transfer:

- Your balance decreases by $100.
- Your friend’s balance increases by $100.

The total money in the system remains the same. Consistency ensures no money is "lost" or "created" in the process.

**How Databases Implement Consistency**:

- **Constraints and Rules**:
  - Foreign keys, primary keys, and unique constraints ensure consistency.
  - Example: You can’t transfer money to a non-existent account because of a foreign key constraint.
- Example in SQL:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id) VALUES (1, 123);
  INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id) VALUES (1, 456); -- Must reference the existing order_id
  COMMIT;
  ```

If the first insert fails, the second one can’t happen because of the foreign key constraint.

---

### **3. Isolation ("No Eavesdropping")**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2010.png)

**Definition**: Transactions should not interfere with each other. Even if multiple transactions run simultaneously, the result should be as if they were executed one at a time (**serially**).

**Real-Life Analogy**:

Imagine you and your friend are shopping online for the **last iPhone in stock**:

1. You add it to your cart and proceed to checkout.
2. At the same time, your friend also tries to buy the same iPhone.

Without isolation, the database might let both of you buy it, causing issues like double-selling. Isolation ensures one of you gets the phone, and the other is notified that it’s out of stock.

**How Databases Implement Isolation**:

- **Locking**:
  - Transactions lock rows or tables while they’re being processed.
  - Other transactions must wait or operate on a snapshot of the data.
- **Isolation Levels**:
  - Databases provide different levels of isolation depending on the use case:
    1. **Read Uncommitted**: Transactions can see uncommitted changes (fast but risky).
    2. **Read Committed**: Transactions see only committed changes.
    3. **Repeatable Read**: Ensures data read multiple times doesn’t change during the transaction.
    4. **Serializable**: The strictest level, ensuring full isolation.
- Example in SQL:
  ```sql
  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE product_id = 101;
  COMMIT;
  ```

---

### **4. Durability ("It Stays Saved")**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2011.png)

**Definition**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if the database crashes immediately afterward.

**Real-Life Analogy**:

Imagine writing a diary entry and then locking it in a fireproof safe. Even if your house burns down, the diary entry remains intact.

**How Databases Implement Durability**:

- **Write-Ahead Logs (WAL)**:
  - Before committing a transaction, changes are written to a log on disk.
  - If a crash occurs, the database can replay the log to recover the committed transactions.
- **Checkpoints**:
  - Periodically, the database saves its state to disk, reducing the need for full recovery from logs.
- Example in SQL:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com');
  COMMIT; -- Ensures data is written to durable storage
  ```

---

### **Why ACID Matters**

Without ACID, databases would be prone to:

1. **Partial Updates**: Half-completed transactions causing corrupted data.
2. **Inconsistent Data**: Breaking business rules or constraints.
3. **Concurrency Issues**: Transactions overwriting each other’s changes.
4. **Data Loss**: Crashes wiping out committed transactions.

---

### **What Happens If ACID is Broken?**

Let’s use a bank as an example:

1. **Atomicity Fails**:
   - Money is deducted from your account, but never added to your friend’s.
2. **Consistency Fails**:
   - Total money in the system becomes incorrect.
3. **Isolation Fails**:
   - Two people withdraw money at the same time, but the balance isn’t updated correctly.
4. **Durability Fails**:
   - After a crash, your account balance is reset to an earlier value.

---

### **Summary Table**

| **ACID Property** | **Key Idea**                 | **Real-Life Analogy**                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Atomicity**     | All-or-nothing execution     | Withdrawing cash: Deduct and dispense or do nothing.   |
| **Consistency**   | Always valid states          | Money transfer: Balances must always add up correctly. |
| **Isolation**     | Transactions don’t interfere | Buying the last iPhone without double-selling.         |
| **Durability**    | Changes are permanent        | Diary in a fireproof safe after writing.               |

---

### **What is Read Committed Isolation?**

**Read Committed** is a **transaction isolation level** in databases. Its main rule is:

> A transaction can only read data that has been committed by other transactions.

This means:

1. **No Dirty Reads**: Your transaction won’t see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
2. Data can change **while you're reading it**, as long as those changes are committed by other transactions.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy: Supermarket Price Tags**

Imagine you’re shopping at a supermarket:

1. When you look at the price of an apple, it’s only the **official price tag** (committed price).
2. The store staff might be updating the prices on their tablet (uncommitted changes), but you don’t see those updates until they’re finalized and the new price tag is put up.
3. However, if you check the price again after a few minutes, it might have changed because the staff **committed the new price**.

---

### **How Read Committed Works**

Let’s break it into steps using a database:

### Example Scenario:

- You’re managing a **bank database** with two customers: Alice and Bob.
- Alice has $500, and Bob has $300.

### Transactions:

- **Transaction A**: Deduct $100 from Alice’s account and commit.
- **Transaction B**: Read Alice’s balance.

---

### **Step-by-Step Example:**

1. **Transaction A (In Progress)**:
   - Deduct $100 from Alice’s account.
   - Alice’s balance becomes `$400`, but **this change isn’t committed yet**.
2. **Transaction B (Read Alice’s Balance)**:
   - Since **Read Committed** doesn’t allow dirty reads, Transaction B can’t see Alice’s `$400` yet.
   - Transaction B reads Alice’s committed balance: `$500`.
3. **Transaction A (Commit)**:
   - Changes are finalized, and Alice’s balance is now `$400`.
4. **Transaction B (Read Again)**:
   - If Transaction B reads Alice’s balance now, it will see `$400`.

---

### **Key Behavior of Read Committed**

1. **Prevents Dirty Reads**:
   - You can only read data that is committed, avoiding "half-baked" or uncommitted changes.
   - Example: You’ll never see Alice’s `$400` until Transaction A commits.
2. **Allows Non-Repeatable Reads**:
   - If you read the same data twice in a transaction, it might **change between reads** because other transactions may commit in the meantime.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice'; -- Reads $500
     -- Meanwhile, another transaction commits a change.
     SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice'; -- Reads $400
     COMMIT;
     ```

---

### **Real-Life Example in SQL**

Here’s how Read Committed isolation works in SQL:

### Setting the Isolation Level:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Transaction A: Deduct $100 from Alice's account
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Transaction B: Try reading Alice's balance
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Transaction A: Commit the change
COMMIT;
```

### Expected Behavior:

- Transaction B will **only see Alice’s old balance** ($500) until Transaction A commits.
- After the commit, Transaction B will see the updated balance ($400).

---

### **Advantages of Read Committed**

1. **Prevents Dirty Reads**:
   - Ensures that transactions don’t read uncommitted (and potentially invalid) data.
2. **Better Concurrency**:
   - Other transactions can still read committed data without being completely blocked by locks.
3. **Widely Used**:
   - It’s a **default isolation level** in many databases (like PostgreSQL and Oracle) because it provides a good balance between performance and consistency.

---

### **Limitations of Read Committed**

1. **Non-Repeatable Reads**:

   - If you read the same data twice, it might change if another transaction commits in the meantime.
   - This can lead to inconsistencies in scenarios where you need stable data.

   **Example**:

   Let’s say you’re calculating the total account balance:

   ```sql
   SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1; -- Reads $500
   SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 2; -- Reads $300
   -- Total: $800
   ```

   If another transaction modifies one of the accounts between your reads, the total might become incorrect.

2. **Doesn’t Prevent Lost Updates**:
   - If two transactions update the same data, the second update might overwrite the first without noticing.

---

### **How Databases Implement Read Committed**

1. **Locks**:
   - Shared locks are used for reading data, ensuring no one else can write to the row while it’s being read.
   - Exclusive locks are used for writing data, ensuring no one else can read or write until the transaction commits.
2. **Snapshots** (In MVCC Databases):
   - In systems like PostgreSQL, a **snapshot** of committed data is taken at the start of each query.
   - This ensures you only see committed changes, even if another transaction is modifying the same data.

---

### **When to Use Read Committed?**

1. **General Use Cases**:
   - When you don’t need perfectly stable reads but want to avoid reading uncommitted data.
   - Example: Banking, e-commerce inventory management, etc.
2. **High Concurrency**:
   - When you want good performance and can tolerate non-repeatable reads.

---

### **Comparison to Other Isolation Levels**

| **Isolation Level**  | **Dirty Reads?** | **Non-Repeatable Reads?** | **Phantom Reads?** | **Performance**     |

| **Read Uncommitted** | Yes              | Yes                       | Yes                | Fastest             |

### **Summary**

- **Read Committed** ensures no dirty reads by allowing transactions to read only committed data.
- **Non-repeatable reads** can occur, meaning data might change between reads in the same transaction.
- It’s a **popular default isolation level** because it balances consistency and performance.

---

### **What is a Snapshot of Committed Data?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2012.png)

In databases with MVCC, a **snapshot** is a version of the data **as it exists at a specific moment in time**—typically when a query begins. This snapshot includes only **committed changes** made by other transactions. Uncommitted changes are ignored.

So, when a query starts:

1. The database captures the current, **consistent view** of the data.
2. This snapshot ensures that even if another transaction modifies the data, your query will only see the state of the data **as it was when the query began**.

---

### **Why is a Snapshot Needed?**

Without a snapshot, queries could read:

1. **Uncommitted data**: Changes made by transactions that haven’t committed yet (dirty reads).
2. **Inconsistent data**: Data that’s being updated by other transactions while your query is running.

By using snapshots:

- You avoid reading uncommitted changes.
- Your query sees a consistent view of the database throughout its execution.

---

### **How Snapshots Work in MVCC**

To understand snapshots, let’s look at how **MVCC** works:

1. **Versioned Data**:

   Every row in the database has **multiple versions**, each with metadata that tracks:

   - When the version was created (e.g., the transaction that wrote it).
   - When the version was deleted or updated (if applicable).

2. **Transaction View**:

   When a transaction or query starts, it gets a **snapshot timestamp**. This timestamp determines:

   - Which versions of rows are **visible** to the query (i.e., those committed before the snapshot timestamp).
   - Any changes made by transactions that started after the snapshot are ignored.

3. **Query Execution**:

   During query execution:

   - The database ensures your query only reads rows that were committed before your snapshot timestamp.
   - Other transactions can continue modifying the data, but their changes won’t affect your query.

---

### **Example: Snapshot in Action**

### Scenario:

- A table called `accounts` has the following data:
  ```yaml
  | ID   | Balance | Last Updated |
  |------|---------|--------------|
  | 1    | 1000    | 2025-01-20   |
  | 2    | 500     | 2025-01-21   |
  ```
- **Transaction A** starts at `10:00 AM` and reads `accounts`. Its snapshot includes:
  ```yaml
  | ID   | Balance | Last Updated |
  |------|---------|--------------|
  | 1    | 1000    | 2025-01-20   |
  | 2    | 500     | 2025-01-21   |
  ```
- At `10:01 AM`, **Transaction B** begins and updates the balance for `ID = 1` to `1200`. However, it hasn’t committed yet.
- At `10:02 AM`, Transaction A runs a query to read the balances again.

### What Happens:

- Transaction A **will still see the snapshot of data from 10:00 AM**, meaning it sees `Balance = 1000` for `ID = 1`. It ignores the uncommitted change by Transaction B.

---

### **Key Point: Snapshots Are Query-Specific in Read Committed**

In the **Read Committed** isolation level:

- A **new snapshot** is taken **at the start of each query** within a transaction.
- This means:
  - If one query starts, it uses a snapshot of the committed data at that moment.
  - If another query runs later in the same transaction, it takes a fresh snapshot of the newly committed data.

---

### **Example: Snapshots in Read Committed**

### Scenario:

- A table `inventory` has one row:

  ```mathematica

  | Product  | Quantity |
  |----------|----------|
  | iPhone   | 50       |
  ```

- **Transaction A**:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  -- Query 1
  SELECT Quantity FROM inventory WHERE Product = 'iPhone'; -- Sees 50
  ```
- **Transaction B**:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE inventory SET Quantity = 30 WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
  COMMIT;
  ```
- **Transaction A continues**:
  ```sql
  -- Query 2
  SELECT Quantity FROM inventory WHERE Product = 'iPhone'; -- Sees 30 (new snapshot)
  ```

### What Happened:

- Query 1 in Transaction A saw the original value (`50`) because it used the snapshot of committed data at that time.
- After Transaction B committed its update, Query 2 in Transaction A saw the new value (`30`) because it took a fresh snapshot of committed data.

---

### **Comparison: Snapshots in Read Committed vs Repeatable Read**

| **Aspect**               | **Read Committed**                       | **Repeatable Read**                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Snapshot Timing**      | New snapshot for **each query**          | Single snapshot for **entire transaction** |
| **Non-Repeatable Reads** | Possible (data can change between reads) | Not possible (data stays consistent)       |
| **Use Case**             | Good for high concurrency, low locking   | Better for consistent, stable reads        |

---

### **Summary of Snapshots in Read Committed**

1. A **snapshot of committed data** ensures no dirty reads.
2. A **new snapshot** is taken at the start of **each query**, meaning data can change between queries in the same transaction.
3. It balances **consistency** and **performance**, making it a widely-used isolation level.

### **What is Snapshot Isolation?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2013.png)

Snapshot Isolation means **every person gets their own copy of the library when they enter**.

You can:

1. Read all the books from your copy (snapshot).
2. Write notes (update data), but you’re only allowed to save those notes **if no one else saved conflicting notes on the same book while you were working.**

---

### **Real-Life Analogy: A Magical Library**

Imagine there’s a magical library:

- Every time you walk in, the library gives you a copy of all the books **as they looked at that moment**. 🕒
- This is your **snapshot**.
- If someone else updates a book (like adding a new chapter), you won’t see it unless you leave and come back.

When you’re done making changes, the library checks:

> “Did anyone else touch the same book and save changes while you were working?”

If no one did, your changes are saved.

If someone else already updated that book, the library says:

> “Sorry, you can’t save your changes. Try again.”

---

### **How Does Snapshot Isolation Work?**

1. **You Get a Snapshot**:
   - When you start reading, you see a “frozen” copy of the data (the books).
   - Changes made by others during your transaction are **invisible to you** until they commit.
2. **You Write Changes**:
   - You can make changes to your snapshot.
   - When you commit (save), the database checks for conflicts.
3. **Conflicts are Checked**:
   - If no one else changed the same data you updated, your changes are saved.
   - If someone else changed the same data, you get a **write conflict error**.

---

### **Example: Two Friends Borrowing Books**

Let’s say there’s a library with a book catalog:

| **Book**     | **Stock** |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Harry Potter | 5 copies  |
| LOTR         | 3 copies  |

---

### **Friend A**:

- At **2:00 PM**, Friend A starts a transaction and gets a snapshot of the catalog:
  ```
  | Harry Potter | 5 copies |
  | LOTR         | 3 copies |
  ```
- Friend A decides to borrow 1 Harry Potter book:
  ```sql
  UPDATE catalog SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE book = 'Harry Potter';
  ```

---

### **Friend B**:

- At **2:05 PM**, Friend B starts a transaction and gets **their own snapshot** of the catalog:
  ```
  | Harry Potter | 5 copies |
  | LOTR         | 3 copies |
  ```
- Friend B also decides to borrow 1 Harry Potter book:
  ```sql
  UPDATE catalog SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE book = 'Harry Potter';
  ```

---

### **Committing Changes**:

1. **Friend A commits first**:
   - The library checks and sees no one else touched Harry Potter yet. ✅
   - New catalog:
     ```
     | Harry Potter | 4 copies |
     | LOTR         | 3 copies |
     ```
2. **Friend B tries to commit**:
   - The library checks and says:“Wait, Friend A already changed Harry Potter to 4 copies. Your snapshot is outdated!” ❌
   - Friend B gets a **write conflict error** and must restart.

---

### **Key Features of Snapshot Isolation**

1. **No Dirty Reads**:
   - You never see changes from other transactions unless they’re committed.
2. **Repeatable Reads**:
   - The snapshot you get at the start doesn’t change, even if someone else updates data in the meantime.
3. **Write Conflict Check**:
   - If two transactions try to update the same data, only the first one to commit succeeds.
   - The second one gets an error and has to try again.

---

### **When to Use Snapshot Isolation?**

Snapshot Isolation is great when:

- You need **consistent reads** (like in reports or analytics).
- You’re okay with retrying transactions if there’s a conflict.

---

### **Summary**

Snapshot Isolation is like working in a magical library:

- You get your own copy of the books (snapshot) when you start.
- You can read and write without worrying about other people’s changes.
- But if someone updates the same book before you save, you have to try again.

---

### **What is Write Skew?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2014.png)

Write skew happens when **two transactions read the same data, make decisions based on it, and update related but non-overlapping data**, leading to inconsistent results when their changes are combined.

### **Real-Life Example: Doctors on Call**

Imagine:

- Two doctors, **Dr. A** and **Dr. B**, are on call duty.
- A hospital rule states: **at least one doctor must always be on call** at any time.

### Scenario:

1. The database has the following table:

   ```css
   | Doctor | OnCall |
   |--------|--------|
   | Dr. A  | Yes    |
   | Dr. B  | Yes    |

   ```

2. **Transaction A** (Dr. A):

   - Dr. A checks the table and sees Dr. B is on call.
   - Dr. A decides:“Since Dr. B is on call, I’ll go off duty.”

     ```sql

     UPDATE doctors SET OnCall = 'No' WHERE Doctor = 'Dr. A';

     ```

3. **Transaction B** (Dr. B):

   - Dr. B checks the table and sees Dr. A is on call.
   - Dr. B decides:“Since Dr. A is on call, I’ll go off duty too.”

     ```sql

     UPDATE doctors SET OnCall = 'No' WHERE Doctor = 'Dr. B';

     ```

4. **Both transactions commit**:

   - After both updates, the table now looks like this:

     ```css

     | Doctor | OnCall |
     |--------|--------|
     | Dr. A  | No     |
     | Dr. B  | No     |

     ```

### **What Happened?**

- Both doctors relied on **stale data** and assumed the other was still on call.
- The rule (at least one doctor must always be on call) is violated! 🚨

---

### **What is Phantom Writes?**

Phantom writes occur when a **query reads a set of rows**, and another transaction inserts or modifies rows that would have been part of the result, leading to inconsistencies.

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2015.png)

### **Real-Life Example: Exam Invigilation**

Imagine:

- There’s an exam with **30 students**, and a rule states:**Each classroom must have at least one invigilator for every 10 students.**

### Scenario:

1. The database has the following table:

   ```css

   | Classroom | Students | Invigilators |
   |-----------|----------|--------------|
   | A         | 10       | 1            |
   | B         | 20       | 2            |

   ```

2. **Transaction A**:
   - Checks Classroom A and sees there’s already an invigilator.
   - Decides not to assign any more invigilators.
3. **Transaction B**:

   - Inserts 10 more students into Classroom A:

     ```sql

     UPDATE classrooms SET Students = Students + 10 WHERE Classroom = 'A';

     ```

4. **Both transactions commit**:

   - After both transactions, the table looks like this:

     ```css

     | Classroom | Students | Invigilators |
     |-----------|----------|--------------|
     | A         | 20       | 1            |
     | B         | 20       | 2            |

     ```

### **What Happened?**

- Transaction A didn’t account for the extra students added by Transaction B.
- Classroom A now has 20 students but still only 1 invigilator, violating the rule!

---

### **How Do They Differ?**

| **Aspect**           | **Write Skew**                                                         | **Phantom Writes**                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cause**            | Conflicting updates based on stale, related data.                      | Changes to data that modify the **result set** of a query.              |
| **Example Scenario** | Two doctors deciding to go off call.                                   | New rows (or updates) violating a group rule.                           |
| **Common in**        | **Snapshot Isolation** when updates happen without conflict detection. | **Serializable Isolation** when inserts/updates create unexpected rows. |

---

### **How to Prevent Write Skew and Phantom Writes?**

1. **Write Skew**:
   - Use a stronger isolation level like **Serializable**.
   - Serializable ensures that all reads, writes, and decisions are consistent across transactions.
2. **Phantom Writes**:
   - Use **locking** or **Serializable Isolation** to ensure no new rows can be added that affect the query result.

---

### **Summary**

- **Write skew**: Transactions make decisions based on stale data and update related fields inconsistently.
- **Phantom writes**: New or updated rows sneak into the result set, breaking rules or assumptions.

---

### **What is Serial Execution?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2016.png)

Imagine a queue at a **movie ticket counter**. 🎟️

- Only **one person** can be served at a time.
- Everyone else has to wait their turn.

In the database world, **serial execution** means:

- Transactions are executed **one after the other**, in a strict sequence.
- There’s no overlap or parallel processing — a transaction has to **finish completely** before the next one can start.

---

### **How Does It Work?**

Let’s say you have two transactions:

1. Transaction A: Transfer $50 from Alice to Bob.
2. Transaction B: Transfer $30 from Bob to Charlie.

With serial execution:

1. **Transaction A runs first**:
   - The database deducts $50 from Alice’s account and adds it to Bob’s.
2. **Only after A finishes, Transaction B starts**:
   - The database deducts $30 from Bob’s account and adds it to Charlie’s.

No transaction starts until the previous one **completes and commits**.

---

### **Why Use Serial Execution?**

Serial execution is simple and avoids problems like:

1. **Dirty Reads**: No one sees uncommitted changes.
2. **Write Conflicts**: No two transactions update the same data at the same time.
3. **Inconsistencies**: Since everything happens one after another, the order is predictable.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy: Library Queue**

Imagine there’s a single librarian helping people. 📚

- Person A asks to borrow a book. The librarian processes their request completely.
- Only after Person A is done, Person B steps forward.

This way:

- The librarian avoids confusion.
- Everyone gets their turn.

Similarly, in serial execution, each transaction gets its own **exclusive time slot** with the database.

---

### **Advantages of Serial Execution**

1. **Simplicity**: Easy to reason about, as everything happens step by step.
2. **Consistency**: Transactions don’t interfere with each other.
3. **No Deadlocks**: Since transactions don’t overlap, you avoid situations where two processes are stuck waiting for each other.

---

### **Disadvantages of Serial Execution**

1. **Slower**: Since transactions run one after another, it’s not the most efficient way to handle workloads.
2. **Low Throughput**: If you have many users, they all have to wait, which can lead to bottlenecks.

---

### **Why Not Always Use Serial Execution?**

Databases usually aim to run transactions **concurrently** (at the same time) for better performance.

However, concurrency brings challenges like:

- Conflicts (e.g., two people updating the same row).
- Inconsistencies (e.g., one transaction reading uncommitted data).

That’s why **isolation levels** like Serializable exist — they make concurrency behave **as if** transactions were executed serially, but without actually forcing serial execution.

---

### **Summary**

- **Serial execution**: Transactions run one after another, like people in a queue.
- **It’s simple** and avoids all conflicts, but it’s **slow**.
- Modern databases aim to give the **illusion of serial execution** while running transactions in parallel, using techniques like locking or multiversion concurrency control (MVCC).

---

### **What is Two-Phase Locking (2PL)?**

![image.png](/assets/images/af996571-f1af-4810-9bfc-77fcf1e6de15.png)

Two-Phase Locking is a method used in databases to ensure that transactions **follow the rules** and avoid conflicts like dirty reads, lost updates, or other inconsistencies.

It works by breaking the process into **two phases**:

1. **Growing Phase** (Acquiring Locks)
   - The transaction grabs all the locks it needs.
   - No locks can be released during this phase.
2. **Shrinking Phase** (Releasing Locks)
   - Once the transaction starts releasing locks, it can’t acquire new ones.

Think of it as **shopping**:

1. In the **growing phase**, you pick up all the items you want from the store shelves.
2. In the **shrinking phase**, you head to the checkout counter and start paying (you’re done picking up new items).

---

### **Why Do We Use Two-Phase Locking?**

The goal is to ensure **serializability**, which means transactions behave as if they were executed one after another (serially), even though they might actually run concurrently.

By using locks:

- Transactions don’t overwrite each other’s changes.
- Data stays consistent.

---

### **How Does It Work?**

Let’s say we have a database of **bank accounts**:

| Account | Balance |
| ------- | ------- |
| Alice   | $100    |
| Bob     | $200    |

Two transactions are happening at the same time:

1. **Transaction A**: Transfer $50 from Alice to Bob.
2. **Transaction B**: Transfer $30 from Bob to Alice.

### Without Locks

If these transactions happen without locking, they might:

1. Read the same data at the same time.
2. Write conflicting changes (e.g., Alice's balance is wrong because both transactions updated it).

### With Two-Phase Locking

Here’s what happens step by step:

1. **Transaction A** (Growing Phase):
   - Locks Alice’s account for writing.
   - Locks Bob’s account for writing.
2. **Transaction B** (Growing Phase):
   - Tries to lock Bob’s account for writing but has to wait because Transaction A holds the lock.
3. **Transaction A** (Shrinking Phase):
   - Updates Alice’s and Bob’s balances.
   - Releases locks on both accounts.
4. **Transaction B** (Now it can proceed):
   - Locks Bob’s account and Alice’s account.
   - Completes the transfer.

This ensures **serializability** — the transactions happen one at a time, even though they were submitted concurrently.

---

### **Key Rules of Two-Phase Locking**

1. **Locks First, Release Later**:
   - A transaction must acquire all the locks it needs before it starts releasing any locks.
2. **Two Phases**:
   - **Growing Phase**: Locks are acquired, but none are released.
   - **Shrinking Phase**: Locks are released, but no new locks are acquired.
3. **Deadlocks May Happen**:
   - If Transaction A waits for a lock held by Transaction B, and Transaction B waits for a lock held by Transaction A, they’re stuck!
   - Databases detect and resolve deadlocks by aborting one transaction.

---

### **Example: Library Books and 2PL**

Imagine a **library** where students borrow books.

1. **Growing Phase**:
   - Student A grabs "Harry Potter" and "LOTR."
   - Student B wants "Harry Potter" but has to wait until Student A is done.
2. **Shrinking Phase**:
   - Student A finishes reading and returns the books.
   - Now Student B can borrow "Harry Potter."

This ensures no two students try to take the same book at the same time.

---

### **Types of Locks in 2PL**

1. **Shared Lock (S)**:
   - Used for **reading** data.
   - Multiple transactions can hold a shared lock on the same data.
2. **Exclusive Lock (X)**:
   - Used for **writing** data.
   - Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock at a time.

---

### **Variants of Two-Phase Locking**

1. **Strict 2PL**:
   - A transaction holds **all locks** until it commits.
   - Prevents cascading rollbacks (one failure causing others to fail).
2. **Rigorous 2PL**:
   - Similar to Strict 2PL, but locks are only released after the transaction **fully completes**.
3. **Conservative 2PL**:
   - A transaction tries to acquire **all locks upfront** before doing any work.
   - Eliminates deadlocks, but can lead to waiting.

---

### **Advantages of Two-Phase Locking**

1. Ensures **serializability**.
2. Avoids issues like dirty reads and lost updates.
3. Works well for most applications needing strict consistency.

---

### **Disadvantages of Two-Phase Locking**

1. **Deadlocks**:
   - Transactions might block each other, leading to deadlock situations.
2. **Performance Overhead**:
   - Locking can slow down transactions, especially in high-concurrency systems.
3. **Blocking**:
   - If one transaction holds a lock for too long, others must wait.

---

### **Summary**

Two-Phase Locking is like:

- **Phase 1 (Growing)**: Lock everything you need, like grabbing items in a store.
- **Phase 2 (Shrinking)**: Release locks, like putting things back on the shelf or checking out.

It ensures consistency and avoids problems but can lead to deadlocks or delays.

### **What is Serializable Snapshot Isolation?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2017.png)

Imagine you’re playing a **multiplayer video game** 🎮 with your friends, but instead of actually playing at the same time, the game creates a **snapshot** of everyone’s position and actions when the game starts. Each player does their moves separately, but when the game ends, the results are combined as if everyone played in a perfectly organized way, one at a time.

That’s **Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)**:

- It’s a fancy way for databases to let transactions happen **at the same time**, but it feels like they happened one after another (**serially**) when you look at the results.

---

### **How Does SSI Work?**

1. **Snapshot Isolation Basics**:
   - Each transaction works with a "frozen" **snapshot** of the database taken at the moment it starts.
   - It reads and works only with committed data up to that point — ignoring changes made by other transactions that started after it.
2. **Serializable Part**:
   - The database **monitors conflicts** between transactions.
   - If two transactions try to make changes that could mess up the serial order, the database stops one of them (rolls it back).

---

### **Real-Life Analogy: Class Exams**

Imagine a classroom where:

- Every student gets the **same question paper** (the snapshot).
- They work independently (no peeking!).

Now, the teacher checks their answers **one by one** to make sure their work doesn’t overlap or create conflicts:

- If two students claim the same "unique prize," the teacher picks one and asks the other to reattempt (roll back).

This ensures that, even though everyone worked at the same time, the final results are fair and consistent, as if they worked in order.

---

### **Example: Bank Accounts**

Let’s say we have two transactions:

- **Transaction A**: Transfers $100 from Alice to Bob.
- **Transaction B**: Transfers $50 from Alice to Charlie.

Both transactions:

1. Start at the same time and see **Alice’s balance as $200** (snapshot).
2. Work independently based on their snapshots.

### What Happens Next:

- If both transactions complete without interference, the database checks whether their results can coexist **serially**.
- If not (e.g., Alice's balance goes negative due to both withdrawals), the database rolls one transaction back to keep things consistent.

---

### **Why Is SSI Useful?**

1. **High Performance**:
   - Transactions don’t block each other for reads; they can proceed in parallel.
2. **Consistency**:
   - Even though transactions run concurrently, the final results are as if they ran one after another.
3. **Conflict Detection**:
   - The database keeps track of **write conflicts** or situations where transactions might mess up consistency, ensuring only valid results are committed.

---

### **How Does the Database Handle Conflicts?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2018.png)

The database keeps an eye on:

1. **Read-Write Conflicts**:
   - If Transaction A reads data that Transaction B changes, and the final result doesn’t make sense, one transaction gets rolled back.
2. **Write-Write Conflicts**:
   - If two transactions try to update the same data, only one can succeed.

By catching conflicts early, the database prevents inconsistent results.

---

### **Advantages of SSI**

- **Concurrency**: Multiple transactions can work at the same time.
- **Serializable Results**: The database guarantees the same result as if transactions happened in a serial order.
- **No Locking Needed**: Unlike other methods (like Two-Phase Locking), SSI doesn’t rely on locks, reducing delays.

---

### **Disadvantages of SSI**

- **Rollbacks**: Some transactions might fail and need to restart if there are conflicts.
- **Complexity**: The database has to do extra work to track conflicts, which can slow things down for very high workloads.

---

### **In Short**:

- **Snapshot Isolation**: Every transaction gets a "frozen view" of the database when it starts.
- **Serializable**: The database ensures the final results look like transactions happened one at a time.
- **Conflict Detection**: If transactions try to do things that break the rules (e.g., inconsistent results), one gets rolled back.

Think of it like **parallel play in a sandbox** — everyone builds their own castles independently, but the teacher (the database) ensures no one’s castles overlap or destroy each other. 🏰

### **What is Column-Oriented Storage?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2019.png)

Imagine you have a spreadsheet 📊 with **rows** and **columns**.

Here’s a small example:

| ID  | Name    | Age | Country |
| --- | ------- | --- | ------- |
| 1   | Alice   | 25  | USA     |
| 2   | Bob     | 30  | Canada  |
| 3   | Charlie | 35  | UK      |

### **Row-Oriented Storage** (Traditional Databases):

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2020.png)

- Data is stored **row by row**.Example:`[1, Alice, 25, USA], [2, Bob, 30, Canada], [3, Charlie, 35, UK]`

This is great when you need to access or modify **entire rows** of data, like in transactional systems (e.g., banking apps).

---

### **Column-Oriented Storage** (Analytics-Focused):

- Data is stored **column by column**, like this:`ID: [1, 2, 3]Name: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]Age: [25, 30, 35]Country: [USA, Canada, UK]`

This is perfect for **analytical queries** where you only need specific columns (e.g., "What’s the average age?"). Instead of scanning all rows, it just reads the `Age` column, saving **time** and **storage**.

---

### **Why Use Column-Oriented Storage?**

1. **Fast Analytical Queries**:
   - For operations like aggregations, averages, or counts, it reads only the needed columns instead of the entire row.
2. **Better Compression**:
   - Similar data in columns (e.g., many people might share the same country) compresses better than rows with mixed data.
3. **Efficient for Big Data**:
   - When dealing with massive datasets (like in data warehouses), it’s much faster and cost-effective.

---

### **Parquet: The Hero of Columnar Storage** 🦸

**Parquet** is a file format designed for **column-oriented storage**. It’s super popular in **big data ecosystems** (like Hadoop, Spark, etc.).

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2021.png)

---

### **Why Parquet?**

1. **Columnar Storage**:
   - Stores data column by column, making it efficient for **analytics**.
2. **Compression**:
   - Parquet uses advanced compression techniques to reduce file size (e.g., it uses **dictionary encoding** for repeating values like countries).
3. **Schema Support**:
   - Parquet files have metadata that describes the structure of the data (e.g., column names and types).
4. **Big Data Compatibility**:
   - Works seamlessly with tools like Apache Hive, Spark, Presto, etc.

---

### **Example: How Parquet Works**

Take the same table:

| ID  | Name    | Age | Country |
| --- | ------- | --- | ------- |
| 1   | Alice   | 25  | USA     |
| 2   | Bob     | 30  | Canada  |
| 3   | Charlie | 35  | UK      |

**Parquet stores it column-wise, like this:**

- **ID**: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Name**: `[Alice, Bob, Charlie]`
- **Age**: `[25, 30, 35]`
- **Country**: `[USA, Canada, UK]`

If you run a query like:

- "What is the average age?"Parquet reads **only the Age column**, skipping everything else.

---

### **Comparison: Parquet vs Row-Oriented Formats**

| Feature                     | Row-Oriented (e.g., CSV)  | Column-Oriented (Parquet) |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Storage Format**          | Row by row                | Column by column          |
| **Query Speed (Analytics)** | Slower (reads everything) | Faster (reads columns)    |
| **Compression**             | Basic (e.g., gzip)        | Advanced                  |
| **Best Use Case**           | Transactional systems     | Analytical workloads      |

---

### **Where Is Parquet Used?**

1. **Data Warehousing**:
   - Systems like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake use columnar storage for fast analytics.
2. **Big Data Processing**:
   - Apache Spark and Hadoop work well with Parquet for large-scale data processing.
3. **Cloud Storage**:
   - Parquet is widely used in cloud platforms like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Data Lake.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy** 🛒

- **Row-Oriented**: Imagine shopping bags with **all items** for a customer. If you’re looking for apples (age data), you have to dig through each bag.
- **Column-Oriented (Parquet)**: Imagine apples, oranges, and bananas sorted into separate bins. If you only need apples, you grab just that bin.

---

### **Summary**

- **Column-Oriented Storage**: Great for analytics, reads only needed columns, saves time and space.
- **Parquet**: A popular columnar file format that’s efficient, compressed, and optimized for big data systems.

### **What is Data Serialization?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2022.png)

Data serialization frameworks are tools that convert data structures into a format that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. They’re essential for exchanging data between systems (e.g., microservices or distributed systems) or for saving data efficiently.

Let’s break it down into something simple and fun, like sending **messages in bottles** across the sea 🌊!

---

Serialization is like putting a **message into a bottle** so you can send it across the sea (between systems or store it).

- **Serialize**: Write your message, seal the bottle, and send it.
- **Deserialize**: Open the bottle, read the message, and understand it.

---

### **Why Use Serialization Frameworks?**

Serialization frameworks make the process of writing and reading messages faster, smaller, and compatible across systems.

Here’s what they focus on:

1. **Efficiency**: Make messages compact to save storage and bandwidth.
2. **Compatibility**: Ensure different systems (with different languages) can read the message.
3. **Ease of Use**: Make it easy for developers to serialize/deserialize data.

---

### **Popular Data Serialization Frameworks**

### **1. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

- **What it is**: A lightweight, human-readable format.
- **Why use it**: Simple, language-independent, and widely used for APIs (e.g., REST).
- **Example**:
  ```json
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Paris" }
  ```
- **Pros**: Easy to read and debug.
- **Cons**: Bigger file size compared to binary formats; slower to process.

---

### **2. XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**

- **What it is**: A self-descriptive format with tags.
- **Why use it**: Common in older systems and for document-oriented data.
- **Example**:

  ```xml

  <person>
    <name>Alice</name>
    <age>25</age>
    <city>Paris</city>
  </person>

  ```

- **Pros**: Highly structured, supports validation (via schemas).
- **Cons**: Verbose, leading to large data sizes.

---

### **3. Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** 🏎️

- **What it is**: A compact, schema-based binary format developed by Google.
- **Why use it**: Faster and smaller than JSON/XML, ideal for high-performance systems.
- **Example**: Define the schema:Serialized binary message is tiny!

  ```

  message Person {
    string name = 1;
    int32 age = 2;
    string city = 3;
  }

  ```

- **Pros**: Compact, fast, cross-language.
- **Cons**: Hard to debug (binary data isn’t human-readable).

---

### **4. Apache Avro**

- **What it is**: A schema-based serialization format, popular in big data (Hadoop, Kafka).
- **Why use it**: Efficient for data streaming and compatible with schema evolution.
- **Example**: Define a schema:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "record",
    "name": "Person",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "name", "type": "string" },
      { "name": "age", "type": "int" },
      { "name": "city", "type": "string" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Pros**: Compact, supports schema evolution.
- **Cons**: Slightly complex to set up.

---

### **5. Thrift**

- **What it is**: A cross-language serialization framework created by Facebook.
- **Why use it**: Combines serialization and RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).
- **Example**: Define schema:

  ```

  struct Person {
    1: string name,
    2: i32 age,
    3: string city
  }

  ```

- **Pros**: Great for distributed systems; compact binary format.
- **Cons**: Not as popular or lightweight as Protobuf.

---

### **6. MessagePack** 📦

- **What it is**: A binary serialization format, like a "compact JSON."
- **Why use it**: Simple and fast, works well with JSON-like data structures.
- **Example**: Converts:Into binary format.
  ```json
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Paris" }
  ```
- **Pros**: Small, fast, and easy to use.
- **Cons**: Doesn’t support schema definitions like Protobuf or Avro.

---

### **7. Cap’n Proto**

- **What it is**: A super-fast, schema-based serialization format.
- **Why use it**: Focuses on zero-copy serialization, meaning no need to encode/decode in many cases.
- **Pros**: Extremely fast; great for real-time systems.
- **Cons**: Complex to set up; less adoption.

---

### **8. FlatBuffers**

- **What it is**: Another super-fast format from Google, designed for games and real-time apps.
- **Why use it**: Lets you access serialized data **without unpacking** it.
- **Pros**: Blazing fast; no deserialization step needed.
- **Cons**: Not beginner-friendly.

---

### **How to Choose the Right Framework?**

1. **Human-Readable**:
   - If you want something easy to debug: JSON or XML.
2. **Performance and Efficiency**:
   - For small and fast data: Protobuf, Avro, or MessagePack.
3. **Big Data and Streaming**:
   - Avro is great for systems like Kafka or Hadoop.
4. **Real-Time Systems**:
   - Go for Cap’n Proto or FlatBuffers.
5. **Distributed Systems with RPC**:
   - Thrift is a good choice.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy: Sending Packages 📦**

- **JSON/XML**: Writing messages on postcards — readable by humans but bulky.
- **Protobuf/Avro**: Packing items in a tight, efficient box.
- **Cap’n Proto/FlatBuffers**: Sending items already pre-packed in a way they can be used instantly.
- **MessagePack**: A small, compressed package that’s quick to send and unpack.

### **What Are Replicas?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2023.png)

Imagine you have a **library** 📚 with a collection of books.

You want people to **borrow books**, but there's a **huge line** of readers waiting to access the same book. What do you do?

You create **multiple copies of the books** and place them in **different parts of the library**. Now, when someone asks for a book, they can grab it from any available copy, making the process **faster** and **more efficient**. That's what **replicas** do in a database!

---

### **Database Replicas**

In a database, **replicas** are **copies** of your main (or primary) database. The idea is to spread the load of read requests across multiple copies, reducing the strain on the primary database and making read operations faster.

- **Primary (Master) Database**: This is the original database where all the data is **written** and **updated**.
- **Replicas**: These are the copies of the primary database, and they are mainly used to handle **read operations**. They get updated regularly with the latest data from the primary.

---

### **Why Use Replicas?**

1. **Load Balancing**: Spread read requests across multiple replicas, so the primary database isn't overloaded.
2. **High Availability**: If the primary database goes down, replicas can help continue serving read requests, ensuring your application is **still available**.
3. **Scalability**: As your data grows, you can add more replicas to handle the increasing load.

---

### **How Does It Work?**

Let’s break it down with a simple ASCII diagram! 📊

```sql

                   +------------------+
                   |  Primary (Master) | <-- Write Operations
                   +------------------+
                           |
                           | (Syncing Updates)
                           v
         +--------------------+     +--------------------+
         | Replica 1 (Read-Only) |     | Replica 2 (Read-Only) |
         +--------------------+     +--------------------+
                   ^                      ^
                   |                      |
              Read Operations         Read Operations

```

---

### **Key Concepts About Replicas**

1. **Data Synchronization**:
   - **Synchronous Replication**: Every time the primary database is updated, the replicas are updated **immediately**.
   - **Asynchronous Replication**: The primary database is updated, but the replicas get updated with a slight **delay**. This is more common as it doesn't slow down the primary database.
2. **Read vs Write**:
   - **Reads**: Clients can read data from any replica.
   - **Writes**: Writes are only done to the primary database.

---

### **Types of Replication**:

1. **Master-Slave Replication**:
   - The **master** handles all the **writes**, and the **slaves** handle the **reads**.
2. **Master-Master Replication**:
   - Multiple databases can accept **writes** and synchronize with each other. This is less common because it requires resolving **conflicts** when different databases update the same data at the same time.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of the **Primary Database** as the **central kitchen** in a restaurant where the **main cook** prepares the food.

- The **Replicas** are like **different serving counters** around the restaurant that **distribute the food** to customers quickly.
- The **Primary Kitchen** handles all the **food preparation (writes)**, while the **Serving Counters** are responsible for **serving food (reads)** to customers.

---

### **When to Use Replicas?**

1. **Scaling Read-heavy Applications**: If your app needs to serve a lot of users who mostly read data, replicas will help distribute the load.
2. **Improved Fault Tolerance**: If the primary database goes down, replicas can ensure your application **keeps running**, though they won’t handle writes without the primary.

---

### **Summary**

Replicas are simply **copies** of your main database that help you:

- **Distribute read traffic** across multiple databases, improving speed.
- **Increase availability** by making data available even if the primary database goes down.

---

### **What are Stale Reads?**

Imagine you're at a **coffee shop**, and you're checking the **menu** on the wall for the prices of drinks. But guess what? The prices on the menu are **outdated**! Maybe they haven’t been updated yet, and the actual prices are higher. This is similar to what happens with **stale reads** in databases.

In database terms, **stale reads** refer to a situation where you **read outdated data** that has not yet been synchronized with the latest changes.

---

### **When Do Stale Reads Happen?**

Stale reads happen most often when:

1. **Asynchronous Replication** is used (where replicas update with a delay).
2. The **replica** is not yet synchronized with the latest data from the **primary database**.
3. Your system is **read-heavy**, and replicas are lagging behind.

Let’s look at an example to make it clearer!

---

### **Real-Life Example: Online Store**

Let's say you have an **online store** with **inventory data** stored in your database. You’re using **replicas** to handle all the customer queries (reads). The main database (primary) has the actual inventory count.

1. **Update**: You update the inventory count for a product (e.g., decrease stock because someone bought it).
2. **Replication**: The primary database sends this update to all replicas, but it takes some time for them to sync.
3. **Read**: A customer checks the inventory from one of the replicas before the sync happens. They see the **old inventory count** (stale data).
4. **Issue**: The customer might think there's more stock than there actually is, leading to potential issues like **overselling**.

---

### **Dealing with Stale Reads**

1. **Read from the Primary Database** (avoiding replicas for critical reads):
   - **Pros**: No stale data — always the freshest, most up-to-date data.
   - **Cons**: Puts a load on the primary database, especially with high traffic (affecting performance).
2. **Use Strong Consistency Models** (e.g., **Linearizability**):
   - **What is it?**: Every read always returns the most recent write.
   - **How it works**: Guarantees that once a change is made, any subsequent read will reflect that change.
   - **Cons**: It can be slower since it requires more synchronization and waiting for updates.
3. **Read Repair**:
   - **What is it?**: If stale data is read, a process called **read repair** checks if the data is outdated and triggers a sync between the replica and the primary database to fix it.
   - **Pros**: Improves consistency without burdening the primary database with every read.
   - **Cons**: Adds a small overhead in checking for consistency.
4. **Eventual Consistency** (used in many distributed systems):
   - **What is it?**: Over time, all replicas will eventually catch up and synchronize with the latest changes.
   - **Pros**: Scalable, fast, and works well for **non-critical** data.
   - **Cons**: **Inconsistent** data for a brief time — **not suitable for all applications** (e.g., banking, order systems).
5. **Tunable Consistency** (like in **Cassandra**):
   - You can **choose** how fresh the data should be for your application, balancing between performance and consistency.
   - For example:
     - **Consistency level: QUORUM**: Majority of replicas should be up-to-date.
     - **Consistency level: ONE**: Only one replica needs to be up-to-date.
   - **Pros**: Flexible and can be adjusted based on the situation.
   - **Cons**: Requires more fine-tuning.

### **Diagram: Dealing with Stale Reads**

Let’s visualize the issue and possible solutions with a simple diagram:

```mathematica

                   +------------------+                          +------------------+
                   |  Primary (Master) | -- Update Stock -->     | Replica (Read)   |
                   +------------------+                          +------------------+
                           |                                          |
         (Replica sync delay)                                            |
                           v                                          v
                 Stale Read Happens!                                 Fresh Read!

```

---

### **Best Practices to Minimize Stale Reads**

1. **Monitor Replica Lag**: Keep track of how far behind your replicas are, and make adjustments based on the level of tolerance for stale data in your application.
2. **Use Caching**: Cache the data at the client or application level so that you can reduce the number of reads from replicas.
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If you can't avoid stale reads, design your system to degrade gracefully, such as showing a “last updated” timestamp to let users know the data may be outdated.

---

### **Summary**

**Stale reads** happen when you're reading outdated data from a replica that hasn't yet caught up with the primary database. To handle this, you can:

- Read from the primary database.
- Use strong consistency models.
- Use read repair or eventual consistency.

It's all about **balancing consistency** with **performance** and **availability** based on the needs of your application.

## **Single-Leader Replication**

### **What Is It?**

In a **single-leader system**, there is **one leader (primary)** that handles all the **write operations**, and the **followers (replicas)** copy the data from the leader to handle **read operations**.

Think of it as a **classroom** where:

- The **teacher (leader)** writes on the **whiteboard**.
- The **students (followers)** copy what the teacher writes into their notebooks.
- If someone wants to know the latest notes, they can check with the students (followers), but they can't change the notes themselves.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Write Operations**:
   - All writes go to the **leader**.
   - The leader updates its data and then sends the changes to the **followers**.
2. **Read Operations**:
   - Reads can happen on **any follower** to reduce the load on the leader.
3. **Data Flow**:
   - The leader sends updates to all followers asynchronously or synchronously.

---

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2024.png)

---

### **Pros of Single-Leader Replication**

- **Simple** and easy to implement.
- Great for **read-heavy workloads**.
- The leader ensures **consistency** for all writes.

### **Cons**

- **Single Point of Failure**: If the leader crashes, writes will stop until a new leader is elected.
- **Replication Lag**: Followers might serve stale data due to delay in syncing with the leader.

---

## **Multi-Leader Replication**

### **What Is It?**

In a **multi-leader system**, there are **multiple leaders** that can accept **write operations**, and they sync their data with each other. This is like having **multiple teachers** in a classroom who can all write on the whiteboard, and they share their notes to stay in sync.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Write Operations**:
   - Writes can happen on **any leader**, and the changes are propagated to other leaders.
   - Leaders then synchronize with **followers**.
2. **Data Flow**:
   - Leaders exchange updates between themselves and then propagate the changes to their followers.

---

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2025.png)

---

### **Pros of Multi-Leader Replication**

- **High Availability**: If one leader goes down, others can still handle writes.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Leaders can be deployed closer to users in different regions for faster writes.

### **Cons**

- **Conflict Resolution**: If two leaders accept conflicting writes (e.g., updating the same row differently), the system needs a way to resolve the conflict.
- **Complexity**: Maintaining consistency between multiple leaders is more complex.

---

### **When to Use What?**

| Feature             | Single-Leader                   | Multi-Leader                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Use Case**        | Read-heavy workloads            | Write-heavy, multi-region apps     |
| **Consistency**     | Stronger                        | Weaker (needs conflict resolution) |
| **Complexity**      | Simpler                         | More complex                       |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Lower (single point of failure) | Higher                             |

### **Real-Life Examples**

1. **Single-Leader**: Think of a bank where all transactions (writes) go to a central server, but account balance checks (reads) can happen on replicas.
2. **Multi-Leader**: Think of collaborative tools like Google Docs, where multiple users can make changes (writes) from different locations, and the system resolves conflicts later.

---

## **Snapshot Replication:**

- Creating a copy of the whole database at a certain moment in time and then replicating that snapshot to one or more destination servers is known as snapshot replication.

---

## **Transactional Replication:**

- One way to maintain several copies of a database synchronized in real-time is through transactional replication.
- This means any modifications made to a particular table (or group of tables) in one database—referred to as the publisher—are instantly copied to other databases—referred to as subscribers.

---

## **Merge Replication:**

- Merge replication is a database synchronization method allowing both the central server (publisher) and its connected devices (subscribers) to make changes to the data, resolving conflicts when necessary.

## **Write Conflicts in Single-Leader Replication**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2026.png)

In **Single-Leader Replication**, there is **only one leader**, so write conflicts are rare because:

1. All **writes go through the leader**.
2. The leader determines the **order** of writes.

However, conflicts can occur if:

- A follower becomes the new leader during a failure, and updates are out of sync.

### **How to Handle Write Conflicts in Single-Leader Systems**

1. **Leader-Enforced Ordering**:
   - The leader assigns a **global order** to all writes.
   - Followers simply replicate changes in the same order.
   - **Result**: No conflict because the leader resolves all.
2. **Re-Election Syncing**:
   - If the leader fails, a **new leader** is elected.
   - The new leader reconciles uncommitted updates with the followers.
   - **Example**: In PostgreSQL, a follower ensures all logs are replayed before taking over as the leader.

---

> Key Takeaway: Single-leader systems avoid most write conflicts by enforcing a single source of truth (the leader).

---

## **Write Conflicts in Multi-Leader Replication**

![image.png](/assets/images/735569f0-8e00-4b0a-9a17-b3251c3034d9.png)

In **Multi-Leader Replication**, conflicts are **common** because:

1. Multiple leaders accept **writes independently**.
2. These writes may update the **same data** before leaders sync with each other.

### **Example: Online Store with Multi-Leaders**

- You have two **leaders** (Leader A and Leader B) for different regions.
- Both regions update the **same product stock** simultaneously.
  - Leader A: Stock - 5
  - Leader B: Stock - 6
- When leaders sync, they must resolve this **conflict**.

---

### **How to Handle Write Conflicts in Multi-Leader Systems**

1. **Last Write Wins (LWW)**:
   - The write with the **latest timestamp** is accepted.
   - **Issue**: Risk of losing earlier valid data (e.g., overwriting changes).
2. **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**:
   - Use **data structures** that resolve conflicts automatically (e.g., merging counts or sets).
   - **Example**: For a counter, instead of overwriting, add the increments from both leaders.
3. **Custom Conflict Resolution**:
   - Application developers define custom rules for resolving conflicts.
   - **Example**: In a shopping app, prioritize stock updates based on region (e.g., Region A takes precedence).
4. **Synchronous Writes Across Leaders**:
   - Leaders **coordinate writes** before committing.
   - **Cons**: Slower because it requires consensus between leaders.
5. **Quorum Consensus**:
   - A majority of replicas (quorum) must agree before a write is committed.
   - Helps reduce inconsistency but can add latency.

---

### **Strategies to Avoid Conflicts in Multi-Leader Systems**

1. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Divide data so that **different leaders** handle **different subsets** of data.
   - **Example**: Leader A handles **users in Europe**, Leader B handles **users in Asia**.
2. **Read-Your-Own-Writes**:
   - Ensure that a user always reads their own writes by routing their reads and writes to the **same leader**.
3. **Avoid Multi-Leader if Possible**:
   - If conflicts are too costly, consider using **Single-Leader Replication**.

| **Quorum Consensus**      | Distributed systems with strong writes    | Balances consistency and speed | Adds latency                   |

---

### **Key Takeaway**

- **Single-Leader Systems**: Avoid most conflicts because only one leader processes writes.
- **Multi-Leader Systems**: Conflicts are inevitable and require careful resolution strategies like LWW, CRDTs, or application-specific rules.

## **Leaderless Replication**

### **What is Leaderless Replication?**

In **leaderless replication**, there is **no single leader** handling writes. Instead:

- Any replica (node) can accept **both reads and writes**.
- Data is replicated across multiple nodes.
- Conflict resolution happens at **read time or write time**.

Think of it like a **group of friends managing a shared grocery list**. Instead of one leader keeping the list, everyone writes their own updates, and when someone needs the list, they merge all versions together.

---

### **How Leaderless Replication Works**

1. **A client sends a write request to multiple replicas.**
2. **A client sends a read request and gathers responses from multiple replicas.**
3. **If conflicts exist, a reconciliation strategy is applied** (e.g., last-write-wins, quorum-based merging).

---

### **Diagram: Leaderless Replication Workflow**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2027.png)

- The client directly interacts with multiple nodes.
- Any node can handle reads/writes.
- Replicas **sync later** using mechanisms like **gossip protocols**.

---

### **Advantages of Leaderless Replication**

✅ **High Availability** – No single point of failure.

✅ **Write Flexibility** – Any node can accept writes.

✅ **Resilient to Network Partitions** – Even if some nodes are down, the system can continue to work.

✅ **Good for Large Distributed Systems** – Used in NoSQL databases like **DynamoDB, Cassandra, and Riak**.

---

### **Challenges of Leaderless Replication**

⚠ **Conflict Resolution Needed** – Different nodes may store different versions of the same data.

⚠ **Inconsistency Possible** – Nodes may have outdated data if they haven’t synchronized.

⚠ **Read Repair is Required** – Some strategies, like quorum-based reads, help fix outdated data.

---

## **Techniques for Handling Stale Data & Conflicts**

1. **Quorum Reads/Writes (N, R, W)**

   - The system defines:
     - **N** = Total replicas storing data.
     - **R** = Number of replicas required for a successful **read**.
     - **W** = Number of replicas required for a successful **write**.
   - **Rule:** If `R + W > N`, strong consistency is maintained.

   **Example:**

   If `N=3`, `W=2`, `R=2`, then:

   - At least **2 nodes must acknowledge a write** before it's considered successful.
   - A **read from 2 nodes** ensures getting the latest data.

   **Diagram: Quorum Reads/Writes**

   ```css
   Write to W=2 Nodes →  [ Node 1 ✅ ]  [ Node 2 ✅ ]  [ Node 3 ❌ ]
   Read from R=2 Nodes  →  [ Node 1 ✅ ]  [ Node 3 ✅ ]

   ```

2. **Vector Clocks (Tracking Changes)**
   - Each write is **timestamped** to track causality.
   - If conflicting writes exist, the client must resolve them.
3. **Read Repair**
   - When a client detects **outdated data**, it updates nodes in the background.
4. **Gossip Protocols**
   - Nodes periodically sync with random peers to **spread updates**.

### **Real-World Use Cases**

🚀 **Amazon DynamoDB** – Uses leaderless replication for high availability.

📡 **Apache Cassandra** – Allows decentralized writes, using quorum-based consistency.

📨 **Riak Database** – Uses vector clocks to handle conflicting writes.

---

### **When to Use Leaderless Replication?**

✔ **Best for read-heavy and availability-critical systems.**

✔ **Ideal for globally distributed databases (multi-region systems).**

✔ **Great when eventual consistency is acceptable.**

❌ **Not ideal for banking or critical transactions needing strong consistency.**

### **Comparison: Leader vs. Leaderless Replication**

| Feature             | **Leader-Based Replication**                | **Leaderless Replication**  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Writes**          | Only on the leader                          | Any node can accept writes  |
| **Reads**           | From leader or followers                    | From any node               |
| **Consistency**     | Strong (but possible lag)                   | Eventual consistency        |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Lower (leader is a single point of failure) | High (no leader dependency) |
| **Use Case**        | Banking, transactions                       | Distributed NoSQL databases |

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Leaderless replication removes the single point of failure.**
- **Conflict resolution happens at read/write time using quorum or vector clocks.**
- **Great for high-availability systems but requires careful consistency handling.**

## **Quorum and Apache Cassandra**

**What is Quorum in Distributed Databases?**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2028.png)

In distributed databases like **Apache Cassandra**, **quorum** is a way to ensure **consistent reads and writes** by requiring a majority of replicas to agree before confirming an operation.

🔹 **Why use quorum?**

- Prevents stale reads by ensuring a majority of replicas have the latest data.
- Balances **availability** and **consistency** in an eventually consistent system.
- Avoids conflicts by requiring a minimum number of replicas to acknowledge an operation.

---

## **How Quorum Works**

Cassandra uses a **replication factor (N)** to determine how many copies of data exist across nodes.

### **Quorum Write Example**

1. A client writes **X = 100**.
2. The write is sent to **3 nodes**.
3. **2 out of 3 nodes must acknowledge** the write before it is confirmed.

![image.png](/assets/images/f131d9e6-2380-405e-8227-366c0fe9a34e.png)

Since **2 out of 3** nodes confirmed, the write is successful.

---

### **Quorum Read Example**

1. A client requests **X**.
2. The system reads from **at least 3 nodes**.
3. If there's a difference, the latest version is returned.

![image.png](/assets/images/1bb5fc43-70de-48f3-abfb-ae691fb5b1cd.png)

This ensures we don't return stale data.

---

## **What is Apache Cassandra?**

🔹 **Cassandra** is a **leaderless, distributed NoSQL database** designed for **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.

🔹 Uses **peer-to-peer replication** with **quorum** to balance consistency and availability.

🔹 Used by **Facebook, Netflix, Uber, Twitter** for massive-scale data storage.

---

## **Cassandra’s Quorum in Action**

![image.png](/assets/images/image%2029.png)

### **Key Cassandra Concepts**

- **Replication Factor (N)** → Number of copies of data.
- **Consistency Level (CL)** → Defines how many replicas must acknowledge a read/write.
- **Tunability** → Cassandra lets you **adjust** consistency from `ONE` (fast but less consistent) to `ALL` (strong consistency but slower).

### **Trade-offs in Cassandra**

| Consistency Level | Availability | Consistency | Performance |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| **ONE**           | ✅ High      | ❌ Weak     | ✅ Fast     |
| **QUORUM**        | 🟢 Medium    | 🟢 Strong   | 🟢 Balanced |
| **ALL**           | ❌ Low       | ✅ Strong   | ❌ Slow     |

**Use Case Example:**

- **Banking System:** Needs `QUORUM` or `ALL` for transaction consistency.
- **Social Media Feeds:** Uses `ONE` for high availability and performance.

---

### **Why Cassandra Uses Quorum?**

🔹 Ensures **eventual consistency** while keeping availability high.

🔹 Prevents **stale reads** by requiring a majority confirmation.

🔹 Works well in **multi-region databases** where **some nodes might be down**.

---

### **Summary**

✅ **Quorum ensures a majority of replicas agree on a read/write.**

✅ **Cassandra uses quorum for balancing consistency and availability.**

✅ **Higher quorum = stronger consistency but slower performance.**
